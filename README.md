This is a linear regreesion project I completed as part of my data science qualification. 

This dataset contains information on individual medical insurance bills. Each bill is associated with some demographic and personal characteristics of the person who received it. We're interested in how these different characteristics relate to the total medical cost. We want to construct the best possible predictive model for the cost, given some information about the patient. Predicting medical costs is an important task because it allows hospitals to predict revenue and plan necessary procedures needed by its patient population.
